# Open Exchange

The Open Exchange is a distributable application host for 1Color token swaps. It runs on
[skein](https://github.com/shruggr/skein)'s host, used as a library. The AMM itself is a
library, [skein-amm](https://github.com/shruggr/skein-amm): the token app, its programs and
the page library. Open Exchange adds the host program, the `swap` app, the images and the
setup. The design is in shruggr/open-exchange#1 and shruggr/skein#164.

## The shape

- **swap**: the instance that serves the Swap, Liquidity, Your tokens and Settings pages.
  - It records root's decisions as facts under its own heads.
  - It emits each fact as an event.
  - It asks nothing of anyone, and nothing answers back.
- **The host** (`open-exchange run`): skein's host, `skein-host run`, plus its wiring for
  swap's events.
- **The token instances**: one per enabled token, at `<origin>/@<tokenId>`.
  - Each comes from the image `token`, which installs skein-amm's token app.
  - Each is born owned by the host's key: no claim.
  - Each takes its deploy BEEF as an event on the token app's route.
- **discovery**: the 1Color discovery topic `tm_color` and its lookup `ls_color`.
  - It comes from the image `discovery`, which installs skein-1color.
  - `setup` makes it. The Settings switch only starts and stops it.

## The events (swap's app `amm`, box `amm/admin`, root's messages)

| root's message | swap records | event | the host |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enable {tokenId, beef?}` | row `enabled` under `amm/tokens`, the BEEF kept | `token-enabled {tokenId, beef, terms?, market?}` | see below |
| `disable {tokenId}` | row `disabled` | `token-disabled {tokenId}` | stops the instance (disabled; off its libp2p node); never removes it |
| `discovery {on}` | `{on, since}` under `amm/discovery` | `discovery-on` / `discovery-off` | starts / stops `discovery` |
| `defaults {terms?, market?}` | `amm/defaults` | none | the next `token-enabled` events carry them |

When `token-enabled` names a token that has no instance yet, the host:

1. Creates the instance `<tokenId>` from the image `token`, disabled.
2. Records its names `[tm_color_<id>, ls_color_<id>, ls_amm_<id>]` for routing.
3. Feeds in the deploy as `{kind: "deploy", beef}` in `amm/deploy`. The door checks the BEEF.
4. If the deploy is admitted, publishes the instance.
5. Sends `terms` into `amm/validator` and `market` into `amm/amm-p2p`, each as root's
   message signed by the host's key.

If the door refuses the deploy:

- **A file store**: the instance is removed.
- **A set** (the host's SQLite database, RocksDB or LMDB): the instance is left disabled,
  because a set cannot be removed.

When `token-enabled` names a token whose instance exists:

- **A stopped instance**: it is started.
- **An instance with no token**: its deploy is fed in.

Every reaction is idempotent and logged.

**At start**, `run` reconciles the host's instance table with swap's heads:

- `/amm/tokens`:
  - `enabled` means the instance is made running.
  - An enabled token with no instance is created. Its BEEF is read from swap's last
    `token-enabled` event in swap's log.
  - `disabled` means the instance is stopped.
- `/amm/discovery`: on means `discovery` is started; off means it is stopped.

Reads on swap (anyone):

- `/amm/tokens`: `[{tokenId, topic, sym, dec, icon?, status, since}]`
- `/amm/defaults`
- `/amm/discovery`: `{on, since}`
- `/`: the pages

## Requirements

- **Node 24 or later**, on any platform node runs on. Nothing else: no toolchain.
- **skein 0.1.0**, the npm dependency (`package.json`). Its host is built to JavaScript, and its
  kernel is one wasm file the host loads: one machine per active instance on a worker thread,
  every instance a set of the host's one SQLite database (`SKEIN_STORE_SQLITE`, the default
  `setup` writes). A host.env naming `SKEIN_STORE_ROCKSDB` runs skein's native kernel process
  instead; that needs a skein checkout with its kernel built (the hosted shape).
- **One key** (skein#160): `SKEIN_KEY_FILE`. It owns every instance Open Exchange makes.
- **The images**: this repository's `image/`. Open Exchange sets `SKEIN_IMAGES_DIR` to it.

## Setup and run

```
npx open-exchange setup --admin <your wallet's identity key>   # once, with the host stopped
npx open-exchange run
```

`setup` does the following:

- If `$SKEIN_HOME/host.env` is absent, writes it with one key, the host's SQLite database
  (`SKEIN_STORE_SQLITE=$SKEIN_HOME/store.sqlite`, the wasm kernel) and swap at the root.
  Add the network, origin, ports, headers feed and Arcade, as `skein-host` takes them.
- If the key file is absent, makes it (mode 0600).
- Makes the host skein, as `skein-host init` does.
- Creates `swap` from the image `swap`.
- Grants root on `swap` to `--admin`.
- Creates `discovery` from the image `discovery`.
- Registers discovery's `tm_color` and `ls_color` by root's messages.

Running `setup` again changes nothing that already exists.

`run` takes every setting `skein-host run` takes from `host.env`. It serves everything
`skein-host` serves:

- bare-host routing by topic
- pages
- libp2p
- the chain feed
- Arcade

## Images (`image/<name>/etc/apps.json`, merged over skein's default image)

| image | installs |
|---|---|
| `swap` | skein-chain v0.7.1 (tarball; 0.7.1: a reorg broadcasts nothing), `../../apps/swap`; root's route `/` → the pages |
| `token` | skein-chain v0.7.1, skein-amm v0.24.1 (tarballs, by tree hash; 0.24.1: skein-overlay 0.20.0 and skein-1color 0.13.1, the settled sync design — announce, then fetch; no wants; every proof published); root's `/submit`, `/lookup` |
| `discovery` | skein-chain v0.7.1, skein-1color v0.13.1 (tarballs; engine skein-overlay 0.20.0); root's `/submit`, `/lookup` |

## Build and test

```
zig build test                      # the swap program's tests
zig build bin                       # apps/swap/bin/config.wasm (committed)
scripts/www.sh                      # apps/swap/www (committed): skein-amm v0.22.1's web/ui + the 1Color pages
npm install --no-save <skein-0.1.0.tgz>   # skein from its `npm pack` until it is published
npm run typecheck                   # host/ and scripts/ against node_modules/skein
npm run build                       # dist/ (what the package runs; `npm pack` builds it)
[SKEIN_REPLAY_DIR=<skein checkout>] [SKEIN_EQUIV_STORE=rocksdb|file] npm run accept
```

The acceptance runs on the wasm host by default. `SKEIN_REPLAY_DIR` names a skein checkout with
its native kernel built: every store is then replayed by the native reference. From a package
install: `node node_modules/open-exchange/dist/scripts/accept/ox-accept.js`.

The acceptance (`scripts/accept/ox-accept.ts`) uses a scratch regtest host. It walks
through these steps:

1. setup
2. run
3. enable: the instance is born, its deploy admitted, its names served, its beats seen, and
   bare-host `/lookup` is routed to it
4. disable, then enable again
5. discovery off, then on
6. a restart, with reconcile
7. a replay of every store
